# Twitter Bio Collector

This script automates the process of collecting Twitter user bios based on a search query for "blockchain developer". It uses the Helium library to interact with the web browser and collects bios and links into CSV files.

## Installation

First, you need to install the required Python libraries. Make sure you have Python installed on your system, and then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:
python twitter_bio_collector.py

You will be prompted to enter your Twitter login credentials. Please ensure you input correct details as the script will use these to log in to Twitter.

## Output
The script will generate two CSV files:

nlinks.csv: Contains the links to the profiles.
bios.csv: Contains the bios collected from each profile.
